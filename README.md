This repository contains examples and demonstrations of how to use [Eclipse Ditto](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto).

# Projects

## [grove control](grove-ctrl/)

The grove control project shows the different communication possibilities
using Eclipse Ditto on your local machine and a Rasperry Pi with GrovePi+ board
as IoT device. This project uses Python for the Raspberry Pi code and jQuery for the Web UI.

## [Rest to WebSocket demo](rest-to-websocket/)

This example shows how to combine the REST and WebSocket API of Eclipse Ditto.
This is demonstrated using a Frontend that sends REST requests and
a Thing that has a WebSocket connection to Ditto and uses it to receive
and respond to Messages. This project requires a running Eclipse Ditto
instance and a modern web browser.
